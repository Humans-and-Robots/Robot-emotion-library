Below are instructions on how you should install the wrapper:

1) Download the wrapper.zip.
2) Make sure you did not compile the node_server project in the Framework. That is, unlike the other projects (e.g. RME), you did not run ‘make’. If you did, simply clean it.
3) Copy the entire folder at  /home/pi/HROS1-Framework/Linux/project/node_server/api_wrapper to
/home/pi/HROS1-Framework/Linux/project/api_wrapper2/api_wrapper2

* You can use the “$sudo cp -r” command

** This will create a new folder called api_wrapper2 in the /Linux/project/ directory. It will also copy the api_wrapper folder from the /project/node_server/ directory and rename it to api_wrapper2

4) Replace the main.cpp in that folder with the main.cpp in the provided .zip and run make

5) You should be able to import the api.py module no matter where it is located and it should work.

6) To test the python wrapper run the program test.py.
